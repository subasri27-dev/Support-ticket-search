# Support Ticket Search System

Support Ticket Search System — TF-IDF + Inverted Index
A Flask-based web application that allows users to describe a support issue in plain English and instantly find the most relevant matching ticket from a knowledge base. The system uses TF-IDF vectorisation, an inverted index for candidate retrieval, and cosine similarity for ranking — providing transparent, explainable results at every phase of the search pipeline.

## Live Demo
https://support-ticket-search-qs4k.onrender.com

## Features

-Natural language search for support tickets  
-TF-IDF vectorization for document representation  
-Inverted index for efficient search   
-Cosine similarity ranking  
-Web interface using Flask  
-Displays ranked results with similarity scores 

                
## Technologies used in the project:

Python 3.x   
Flask — web framework  
scikit-learn — TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity  
NLTK — tokenisation, lemmatisation, stop word removal  
NumPy — vector operations  
Gunicorn — production WSGI server (for deployment)  
HTML / CSS / JavaScript — frontend interface


## Installation

1.Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.   
2.Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
3.Activate the virtual environment  
Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Mac / Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
4.Install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

    
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/subasri27-dev/Support-ticket-search
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
 cd support-ticket-search
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server

```bash
  python app.py
```

Open your browser and visit

```bash
  http://localhost:8080
```

The Support Ticket Search System interface will appear, where you can enter a query and retrieve relevant support tickets.
## Deployment

The application is deployed using Render with Gunicorn as the production server.
